#Script for AIESEC in Italy MKTG Tool's CS booking automation

My name is Koru, the MKTG VP of AIESEC in Padova. 
This is a small script I wrote on Google's Apps Script for speeding up the process of sending mails for CS booking through the 'ðŸ’¡CS funnel tracking' sheet of B2C/MKT Tracking Tool.

HOW TO SET: Open the sheet in the Spreadsheets you'd like to set the script in

Go to 'Extentions' -> 'App Script'

Log in and paste the code to a new script.

Accept the permission request of the script. If you don't trust it you can check in with your MCVP or ask for malicious piece of code to an AI.

Arrange the code (there are comments to help you) to match the columns relevant to your mail template. By default there's the template I use.

You can choose which mail you'd like to be added to CC by changing the variable 'ccEmail'

HOW TO USE:

Once you modified it to your liking, choose the row you'd like to send a mail for.
Click 'CS mail actions' next to 'help' option in the menu above, and click 'Prepare CS mail draft'
Choose your preferred language and click 'OK'
Copy the generated link and open it in a new page
Do the necessary modifications and checks on the mail, then click send
